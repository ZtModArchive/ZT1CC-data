The Fieldview Zoo, just outside of London, England, has just hired you to run their facility. The directors have given you a goal of purchasing a mated pair of pandas and getting the pandas to mate. In order to attract the attention of the Chinese government, you will need to raise the visibility of the zoo. The Chinese Panda Committee won't even consider your request until you have at least 15 different animal species in highly suitable exhibits.  

In preparation for this event, the zoo has started a new training program for the zookeepers. This program will educate the keepers about the varied and specialized care of pandas. Look under Research and Conservation to begin funding this program.
