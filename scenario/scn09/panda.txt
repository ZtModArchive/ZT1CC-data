A delegation from the Chinese government has just completed a tour of your zoo. They are very impressed with the diversity of animal species and the quality of their care. As a result, they are offering two pandas, a male and female, for you to adopt. They would be most pleased if you can implement a successful breeding program that produces a baby panda.
