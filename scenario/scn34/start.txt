You have been selected to operate a new experimental zoo. It is important to the zoo's founders that you offer free admission to the public. However, you still need to make money to keep the zoo operational. The only way you can do this is to obtain money in other ways, such as concession sales. In order to prove that this sort of zero-admission zoo can last, you need to generate $50,000 in 18 months. Good luck!
