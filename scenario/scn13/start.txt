The government of Kenya has hired you to run a pilot program to save troublesome animals. They want to change the policy of destroying these animals and instead provide a safe place for them to live. Opening up the area to tourists will help provide the resources needed to fund this program.

Local rangers have gathered together some problem animals from around the country and moved them to one large area. These animals have been put in small holding pens around the park.  

Your first task is to build exhibits for these animals. Once this is done, your focus should be on increasing the species variation of African savannah animals.  

To be successful, you only need 20 African savannah species. This could be 20 of the same animal or 20 different species, it's up to you. Just remember that people enjoy seeing lots of different types of animals.
