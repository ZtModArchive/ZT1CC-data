The Burkitsville Zoo has been badly managed during the last few years. The National Association of Zoos has threatened to close down the zoo because of the substandard living conditions for the animals. The town's mayor has appointed you to be the new Zoo Director, with the mandate to return the zoo to its once former success. 

Your first step should be to repair and upgrade the existing animal exhibits. All of the animals are being kept in exhibits that are far too small for them. After that, focus on increasing guest enjoyment by providing much needed services and attractions. Watch your spending; though if you get in real trouble, donations may be available.
