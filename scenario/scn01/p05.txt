You've done excellent work so far. Now you need to make a path so that your guests can see it. 
 
1. On the left side of the gameplay screen, click the Construction button. 
2. Click the Zoo Paths tab, and then click the concrete path icon.
3. Click and drag the cursor to the Bengal tiger's exhibit, and then release the mouse button. Make sure this new path connects to an existing zoo path.

Guests can only view animals from paths that are adjacent to, or one path-width away from, exhibits.

Click the OK button to proceed.
