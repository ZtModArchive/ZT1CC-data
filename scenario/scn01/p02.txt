Your first task is to finish building an exhibit capable of holding a Bengal tiger.

1. On the left side of the game screen, click the Construction button, and then click the iron bar exhibit fence. 
2. Move the cursor to the half-completed exhibit to the right of the camel exhibit.
3. Click and drag the cursor to construct a section of fence that connects the existing fencing, and then release the mouse button. 

To create an exhibit, you need to completely enclose an area with exhibit fencing. Once an exhibit is created, a gate is automatically placed in the fence.

Click the OK button to proceed.
