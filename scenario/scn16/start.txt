An area has been set aside in northwest Alaska as a rehabilitation facility for local animals which have been hurt or abandoned by their parents. These animals will be cared for at this facility with the goal to be released back into the wild.  

The first shipment of animals has arrived and can be found in their shipping cages near the front gate. The animals won't leave these cages until they are placed in valid exhibits. Keep in mind that you will not be able to adopt any animals in this scenario. 

When this first batch of animals are in exhibits with at least a 70 suitability, another shipment will arrive.
