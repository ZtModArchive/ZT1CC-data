Some show animals use certain objects in their tricks. For example, orcas will play with a ball if it is placed in their show exhibit. Placing show objects in a show animal's show tank will unlock more tricks for that animal. The name of the object indicates which animal will use it.

Let's purchase an orca ball and place it in the orca show exhibit.

1. On the left side of the game screen, click the Adopt Animals button.
2. Click the Show Objects tab.
3. Select the orca ball.
4. Place the ball in the orca show exhibit.

Click the OK button to proceed.
