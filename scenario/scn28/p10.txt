Some show tricks must be researched. Trick research is found on the Research tab in the Research & Conservation panel. There is a separate category for each animal that has tricks you can research. Funding one of these categories will allow the animal to learn more tricks. Once a trick has been researched, it may be added to any shows that animal performs.

Let's look at the new trick research now.

1. On the left side of the game screen, click the Research & Conservation button.
2. Click the Research tab.
3. Click the (+) plus button to increase funding to a trick research program.

Click the OK button to proceed.
