Just as exhibit tanks are built using exhibit tank walls, show exhibits are built using show tank walls. Show tank walls are blue and have a star on their icon. Tank walls for both the exhibit and show tank must be adjacent and of the same height in order to create a gate for the animal to pass through. If you don't see a gate, then it is not a valid show exhibit. Your next task is to create an orca show exhibit.

1. On the left side of the screen, click the Construction button, and then click the show tank wall.
2. Move the cursor to the empty area on the map, next to the new orca exhibit.
3. Click and drag the cursor to construct a show exhibit adjacent to the empty exhibit tank.

Click the OK button to proceed.
