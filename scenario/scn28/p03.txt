There are five specific animals that perform shows when placed in a show exhibit: orcas, bottlenose dolphins, California sea lions, sea otters, and even great white sharks! Let's adopt an orca and place it in the tank exhibit with black tank walls.

1. On the left side of the game screen, click the Adopt Animals button.
2. Click the orca icon.
3. Place the cursor over the tank exhibit, and then click to place an orca.

Note: If an animal becomes unhappy because it is overworked or underfed, it won’t perform some of its tricks properly.

Click the OK button to proceed.
