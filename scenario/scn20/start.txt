Millennia ago, a permafrost that covered the world decimated many forms of life on earth. Because of your past successes in managing zoos, you have been given a large plot of land in Greenland. Recent advances in the field of genetics have enabled your research scientists to begin cloning extinct animals. Before attempting to clone such dangerous, large creatures as the mighty T. rex and the Allosaurus, your research scientists urge you to play it safe and build your first zoo just with extinct animals from the Ice Age, who were presumably less dangerous.

You will need to exhibit four Ice Age animals, the Wooly Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), Wooly Rhinocerous (Coelodonta antiquitatis), Saber-toothed Cat (Smilodon fatalis) and the Giant Tortoise (Meiolania platyceps). It is very important to spend money on the Genetic Research Conservation category in order to gain the ability to adopt Wooly Mammoths.
