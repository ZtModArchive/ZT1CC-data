As a member of the Mayor's Taskforce on Urban Renewal, you have been put in charge of creating the city's first zoo. Cramped conditions in the city’s core make this task very difficult. Available land is at a premium, and the city can only afford to purchase a small plot for the zoo.

Your main challenge in this scenario will be space, to which you'll have to pay close attention. Your zoo's confined space will affect its layout, limiting how much you can fit within the allotted area. You have a twelve month contract in which to complete these tasks.
