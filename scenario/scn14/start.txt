The State of Colorado has earmarked some property west of Denver, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, as a location for a new zoo. This zoo is intended to draw tourists who vacation in the mountains. 

The goals are pretty straightforward. The one catch is that much of the land has a steep slope and flat space is at a premium. The best bet is to first focus on animals that are found in this type of habitat. Bighorn sheep, ibex, and markhor all fit this criteria. Once you have a consistent flow of tourist income, start thinking about selective places to level in order to give yourself more flat land for expansion.
