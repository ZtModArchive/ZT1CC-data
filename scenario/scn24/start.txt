After hearing of your successes with running dinosaur zoos, the nation of Argentina has granted you the use of an island in the south Atlantic Ocean. They have a pair of Saber-toothed Cats waiting for your arrival. They are hesitant to clone any dinosaurs more dangerous than these before you get to the island. Once there, you will have a Dinosaur Recovery Team available to you and a huge island. On the island is a research facility that will be cloning the dinosaurs you are to care for.

Every few months, you should receive a new group of dinosaurs to exhibit. In all, you should create suitable exhibits for 10 dinosaurs. The government of Argentina is not interested in any non-dinosaur animals in this zoo. After a few months have passed, there should be a few more dinosaurs available for purchase. The final dinosaur that the scientists clone will be the Apatosaurus. The apatosaurus requires a large exhibit, so be sure to save room for this exhibit.
