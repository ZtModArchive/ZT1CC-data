The government of Argentina has come to you up in arms. Without your guidance, the dinosaurs have all escaped. They now roam freely about the island and no one is brave enough to visit the zoo now. Argentina kindly requests that you return to Dinosaur Island and save them from financial ruin.

Since the dinosaurs are loose on the island, your first task will be to contain all 9 dinosaurs in suitable exhibits. Once that is done, it will be safe to place paths, so that guests will come to the exhibits. By the end of the three years, you should have 12 suitable dinosaur exhibits.
