Your first task is to save a manatee that was hit by a motorboat prop. Construct a suitable habitat and research the Sea Mammal Rescue program. Save the manatee and the government will return it to the wild. Every time you save an animal, you'll receive another to care for. Invest your grant money wisely. Giving these animals a second chance is in your hands!
