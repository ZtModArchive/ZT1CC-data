Congratulations! You have been appointed as the head of a state-funded animal rehabilitation project. The project is an experiment, and whether or not it continues to receive funding depends on how successfully you can save the sick and injured animals you receive. You have two main goals: to heal animals so they can be released into the wild, and to steadily work on researching more advanced techniques for saving injured wildlife.
