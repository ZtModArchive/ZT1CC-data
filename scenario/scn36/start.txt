Unless you can revitalize this zoo in a short period of time, it is going to be destroyed by greedy landowners. In addition to repairing the damaged terrain and making the animals that currently dwell there comfortable, you must prove that the zoo is dedicated to opening new and improved exhibits. To that end, you are challenged to add an aquatic area with healthy marine animals.
