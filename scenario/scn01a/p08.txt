Good grief! You've allowed the lions to run free in the zoo! What were you thinking? Well, we hope you learned your lesson: Never trust the people who write these tutorials, and never clear sections of fence in the lion's exhibit! (Unless you like seeing your guests flee in terror.)

In this tutorial, you've learned the basics of controlling Zoo Tycoon. We recommend you play "Tutorial 2 - Basic Gameplay" to learn the basics of creating a zoo. You are free, however, to play any of the games from the main menu.
