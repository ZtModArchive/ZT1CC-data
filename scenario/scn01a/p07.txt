Finally, let's learn how to remove, or clear, objects from the zoo. We're going to remove one section of fence from the lion's exhibit. (We know, this sounds like it might be a bad idea, but trust us. After all, we're the experts.)

1. Click the Clear Objects tab, located on the left side of the game screen. 
2. Place the cursor over the section of fence you want to clear, and then click to remove one or more fence sections.

You'll get a cautionary message that advises against doing this, but don't worry, we know what we're doing.

Click the OK button to proceed.
