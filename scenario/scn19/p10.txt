You should already have several guests in your zoo viewing the Allosaurus egg and nearby Wooly Mammoth exhibit. Dinosaur Digs introduces new ways of changing the map view so you can see more of what you want to see. In the lower-left corner of the screen, just below and to the right of the mini-map, there are three new buttons. The first toggle button, Hide/Show Guests, allows you to hide all of the guests in the zoo. This can be very useful for finding your staff members who may become lost in the crowd.

Try Hide/Show Guests for yourself. Click the button with the guests in the lower-left corner of the screen once to hide the guests. Then click again to show the guests.
