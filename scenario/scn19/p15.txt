As a zoo tycoon, you've always craved new opportunities to revolutionize your zoo -- you’ve adopted Bengal tigers, bred panda bears, and launched exhibits of other exotic wildlife. You could never have anticipated the discovery that mundane summer morning would bring.

Strolling through your zoo, you see your scientific research team all clad in white lab coats and rushing towards you, each one eager to talk. You can’t make out much of their excited speech and wild gesticulations, but you gather that you had better follow them and check out something happening in the research lab -- and you’d better do it now! Entering the lab, you see a large incubator, and the scientists part to let you get closer. As you approach, you see a tiny lizard-like creature clambering out of its egg. "Say 'Hi' to our new baby kentrosaurus," one of your staff says in tears. A kentrosaurus, extinct for 65 million years -- alive! In your zoo!

The excitement of the moment is quickly intruded upon by the harsh reality of trying to keep a dinosaur in your zoo. Your researchers start showing you plans for new fences, new research programs and new staff. Your work is definitely cut out for you. Welcome to the Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs expansion.
