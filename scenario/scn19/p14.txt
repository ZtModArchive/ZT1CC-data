Whoops! He's not so tame after all, is he? There you go listening to us again....

Truth is, all dinosaurs present a danger to your zoo's guests. In order to keep your dinosaurs in their exhibits, make sure your large dinosaurs are in electrified fencing and all other dinos in reinforced fencing. It is wise to hire a maintenance worker to repair deteriorating fences and a DRT to catch any dinosaurs that escape. What? You don't have a DRT? Oh no, you'd better hire one, quick! The DRT are hired like any other staff, except they come with their own building.

Place the DRT in the area surrounded by concrete path near the exhibit.
