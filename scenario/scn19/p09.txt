In just a moment, the Allosaurus egg will hatch (if it hasn't already) and you will catch your first glimpse of a dinosaur! Once the Allosaurus hatches, it will be important to make its exhibit as suitable as possible. The Allosaurus' favorite type of foliage is the fern bush. The Allosaurus will need a shelter as well. If you make changes to the exhibit before the Allosaurus hatches, you won't be able to see how it feels about those changes, so it's best to wait until it hatches.
