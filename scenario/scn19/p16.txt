Now that you have hired a dinosaur recovery team, they will sedate any escaped dinosaurs or prehistoric animals. Once the dinosaurs are sedated, the scientist will be able to enclose the dinosaur with a specially prepared dinosaur box. Running a zoo with dinosaurs can be a risky proposition if you don't have a DRT. Be sure to hire one as soon as you can afford it. Especially if you have any carnivorous dinosaurs.
