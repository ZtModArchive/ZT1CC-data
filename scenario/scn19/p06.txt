Now that you have hired a scientist, he or she will check up on the dinosaur, keeping the egg healthy. The Allosaurus will hatch after a couple minutes.

While you are waiting for the Allosaurus to hatch, you should place a Dinosaur Recovery Team building. The DRT are an elite group of trained dinosaur wranglers. When a dino escapes, the DRT flies into action, hopping into their fast attack helicopter. The DRT tranquilizes escaped dinosaurs so that the scientist can safely put the escaped dinosaur in a special dinosaur capture box.

Place the DRT building anywhere in the zoo. The closer to the Allosaurus exhibit, the faster the team's response time.
