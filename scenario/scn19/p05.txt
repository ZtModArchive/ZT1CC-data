You will need to hire a scientist to care for the young dinosaur or it may become sick. Scientists take care of dinosaurs and only dinosaurs. They will not care for regular zoo animals, and regular zookeepers will not care for dinosaurs. Scientists will clean up the very large, very smelly dinosaur poo with the JurassiVac BF2000. You will want to assign the scientist to the Allosaurus exhibit. If a dinosaur gets loose, however, the scientist is too smart to attempt single-handed capture of a rampaging dinosaur. Later we'll see how to capture an escaped dinosaur.

Place the scientist in or near the Allosaurus exhibit.
