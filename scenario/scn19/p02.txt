Dinosaur Digs introduces a new feature for finding the game objects you're looking for. The Expansion Pack filter lets you sort the various items you can purchase either by Zoo Tycoon, by Dinosaur Digs, or all content.

To try this, when the construction panel opens, click on the pull-down menu at the top of the panel and choose to sort the content by Dinosaur Digs.
