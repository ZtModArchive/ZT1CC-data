While we wait for your Allosaurus to hatch, we can take the time to look at another new feature of Dinosaur Digs, the Building List tab. This tab is located on the Zoo Status panel. It allows you to view the financial information for all your buildings in one place. You can sort the information by name, months in operation, total number of visitors, total profit, or average profit. You can click either the buttons or the text to sort the information.

Click on the various buttons to sort the data. When you are finished, sort the data by average profit.
