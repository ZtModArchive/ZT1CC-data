You can also hide foliage when you want to be able to make changes to an exhibit. If a dinosaur gets angry, it may trample the terrain or crush its shelter. It becomes much easier to find the trampled terrain or rubble if you hide the foliage.

Toggle Hide/Show Foliage in the lower-left corner of the screen off and then back on.
