The mayor of this small beach town has contacted you in the hopes that you can create an ocean-themed zoo for this area to attract more tourists. The lot has been abandoned for quite some time, and the mayor hopes that you will be able to fill the empty waterfront with a brand-new and bustling marine zoo. Space is somewhat limited in this area--when creating tank exhibits, be sure to consider the confined area with which you have to work. Also, be sure to provide for your guests' needs with the appropriate commerce and attraction buildings.
