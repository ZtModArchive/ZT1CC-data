Over 210 million years ago, the Jurassic era was home to a wide variety of dinosaurs. Using cloning techniques similar to yours, a wealthy industrialist tried to build a zoo for dinosaurs. His attempt was a spectacular failure, but since the exhibits are already in place, it will be cheaper to build your zoo there. You must create suitable exhibits for seven Jurassic-era dinosaurs, including vicious carnivores like the Allosaurus. It will be necessary to invest money in the Genetic Research Conservation category so that you can adopt dinosaurs like the Apatosaurus.
