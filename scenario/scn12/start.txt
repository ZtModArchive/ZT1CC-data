The City of New Orleans, Louisiana, has hired you to run their new zoo. Unfortunately, the only available land is a series of small islands that extend out into the Mississippi River. These islands are in an environmentally sensitive area. Local officials have given their blessing for the zoo's construction on the condition that no sweeping changes are made to the existing terrain. As a result, the change terrain height tool will not be available in this scenario. However, it is acceptable to alter the type of terrain in the exhibits to fit the needs of the animals.
