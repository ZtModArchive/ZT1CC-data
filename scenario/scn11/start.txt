A wealthy benefactor has come forward with a plan to help save some of the world's great cats. She has hired you to open a zoo focused solely on their care and maintenance. The land, which was donated by the U.S. government, is located in the desert near Flagstaff, Arizona. The zoo will be the focal point of a revitalization plan for the area.  

Keep in mind that the black leopard, white Bengal tiger, and snow leopard will need to be researched under Conservation/Endangered Animals.
