During the last 100 years, many species have become extinct. Although not necessarily done on purpose, the natural habitats for many species has been destroyed. Governments around the world now realize this and have established an association to create a sanctuary for endangered species. The Endangered Species Committee has generously donated an island for this refuge and sought you out to direct the creation of this zoo on an island known as Paradise Island. You'll need to work with a team of researchers in preserving the lifeline of endangered species. 

Using funding from various conservation programs, your goal is to create a zoo full of endangered species and construct habitats that truly represent the animals' real environments.

Because you don't have an opportunity to buy animals, make sure you don't sell any of the animals which are donated to the zoo.
