With all of the profits from your many successful dinosaur zoos, you have invested in a large plot of land in Santa Cruz, California, where you can retire. However, you are approached with the challenge of a lifetime!

You must mate two Tyrannosaurus rex so that they conceive a baby T. rex. Also, just caring for one dinosaur is not enough to run a zoo, so you will also need to exhibit at least 14 other dinosaurs or animals in the zoo. A male and female T. rex will be donated to the zoo at the end of the first year.

It is extremely important to complete all Tyrannosaurus rex research programs. Without this valuable research, the tyrannosaurs will not be amiable enough to mate. In addition, the Tyrannosaurus rex female should be kept very happy, or she will be unable to conceive.
