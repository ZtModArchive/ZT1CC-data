The dolphin should be pretty comfortable in there. Now let's discuss a few details about changing the exhibit. You can raise the height of the tank wall from the exhibit panel.

1. Click the feeding platform on the dolphin exhibit you just created.
2. Click the Adjust Wall Up button. Notice how the height of the wall is increased.

This will come in handy as some marine animals prefer their exhibits to be deeper than others.

Click the OK button to proceed.
