In the same way, you can lower the entire marine exhibit by adjusting the base of the tank.

1. On the Exhibit Information panel, click the Recess Tank button. Notice how the whole exhibit is lowered.

Animals have no preference with regard to the position of the tank. This is an aesthetic adjustment.

Click the OK button to proceed.
