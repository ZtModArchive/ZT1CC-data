A tank can be filled with either salt water or fresh water. By default, the tank is filled with salt water. You can change the water type from the exhibit panel.

1. On the still open exhibit panel, click the Change to Fresh Water button. Notice how the color of the water changes.
2. Click the Change to Salt Water button to re-fill the tank with salt water.

All marine animals require salt water in their exhibits. However, many of the zoo animals, like the hippo, prefer fresh water in their tanks.

Click the OK button to proceed.
