Marine Mania adds more new and exciting objects for you to place in your zoo. To help you access these items more easily, the expansion pack filter lets you sort the various items you can purchase either by Zoo Tycoon, Marine Mania, Dinosaur Digs (if you have this expansion), or all content.

To try this, click on the Hire Staff button. When the Hire Staff panel opens, click on the pull-down menu at the top of the panel and choose to sort the content by Marine Mania.

Click the OK button to proceed.
