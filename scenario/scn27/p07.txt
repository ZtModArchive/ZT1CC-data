The dolphin seems happy now. You can purchase a tank filter to clean tanks. Filters prevent the water from getting dirty, but every time it cleans the tank you are charged a fee. While this might cost more, the tank will stay cleaner.

1. Click the Construction button and click the Fence tab.
2. Click the tank filter and place it right next to the marine exhibit.

A tank filter can only be placed in a square adjacent to a tank wall.

Click the OK button to proceed.
