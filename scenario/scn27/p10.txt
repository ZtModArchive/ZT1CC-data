You can also lower a tank wall's height in the same way.

1. With the Exhibit Information panel still open, click the Adjust Wall Down button. Notice how the height of the wall is decreased.

This will come in handy as some marine animals prefer their exhibits to be shallower than others.

Click the OK button to proceed.
