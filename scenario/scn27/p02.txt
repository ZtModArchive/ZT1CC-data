Your first task is to create a marine exhibit capable of holding a bottlenose dolphin.

1. On the left side of the game screen, click the Construction button, and then select any tank wall.
2. Move the cursor to the empty area on the map across from the narwhal exhibit.
3. Click and drag the cursor to construct an exhibit. Remember to completely enclose an area with the tank wall to create an exhibit.

Notice that instead of a gate, a platform is automatically placed. This is where the new marine specialist enters and exits the tank.

Click the OK button to proceed.
