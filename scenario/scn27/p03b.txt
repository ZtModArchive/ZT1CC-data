You can also raise the entire marine exhibit by adjusting the base of the tank. This allows you to create different looks for your exhibits.

1. On the exhibit panel, click the Expose Tank button. Notice how the whole exhibit is raised.

Animals have no preference with regard to the position of the tank. This is an aesthetic adjustment.

Click the OK button to proceed.
