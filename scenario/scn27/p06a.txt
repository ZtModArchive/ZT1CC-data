Marine animals are similar to their zoo counterparts in that they like various foliage and objects in their exhibit. In the case of the dolphin, they really like kelp. 

Let's add some kelp foliage to the dolphin's exhibit.

1. On the left side of the game screen, click the Construction button, and then click the foliage tab.
2. Place kelp in the dolphin tank until the exhibit suitability reaches 76.

Click the OK button to proceed.
