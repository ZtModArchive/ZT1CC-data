Congratulations on your work with the mako shark. It seems very satisfied with its exhibit now. Researchers are still analyzing data gathered from the first two shark species you have cared for. Guests seem to want something a little more than just sharks and lions in the zoo, so a pair of African elephants have been delivered to an area near the entrance of the zoo.
