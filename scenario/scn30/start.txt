An interesting fact about sharks is that they are resistant to the cancers that plague other species. Modern science has yet to explain why this is true. To that end, a zoo is bringing you on board to raise and care for a shark population, in the hopes of studying them to learn new methods to fight cancer. You must integrate sharks into the zoo so they are comfortable and healthy before others are donated. In addition, you'll want to educate as many guests as possible on the benefits of protecting the sharks.
