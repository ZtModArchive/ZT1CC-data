That's more like it. Notice that as you placed the correct savannah trees in the African lion's exhibit, small green happy faces floated up. These indicate that the lion liked the objects you placed in its exhibit. There is another way to tell how much an animal likes its exhibit.  

Click the jaguar and an Animal Information panel will open in the lower-right corner of the screen. The bar at the bottom indicates the current suitability of the exhibit. 

A few more trees are now available. Find the tree that the jaguar will enjoy and place four of them in its exhibit.

Click the OK button to proceed.
