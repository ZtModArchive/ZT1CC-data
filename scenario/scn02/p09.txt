Great job! The African lion is now quite happy with its exhibit. You must complete just one more task before you are ready to manage your own zoo. The zoo has been given two additional clouded leopards. They have been placed in an exhibit that is not yet suitable for them.  

Make this new exhibit suitable by using the existing clouded leopard exhibit as a guide.

Notice that some new items have become available for you to purchase.
