It is important to note that zookeepers will take care of the needs of any animals in land or combined exhibits. They are familiar with the needs of many marine mammals and will be able to use their knowledge to keep walruses and other marine mammals happy and healthy. The California Sea Lion and the Southern sea otter  are special cases -- while zookeepers care for them when they are in a combined exhibit, these animals still require a Marine Specialist to run the show when a show tank is present.

Hire a zookeeper and place them in the walrus' combined exhibit.
