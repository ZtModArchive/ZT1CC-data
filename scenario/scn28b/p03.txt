While most marine animals are content with an exhibit tank alone, there are a few marine mammals that need to access land to rest and feed. Of the many Marine Mania animals available to you, there are three that require land: the Pacific walrus, the northern elephant seal, and the southern sea otter.

The walrus in the tank exhibit needs access to a land exhibit to be truly happy with its surroundings. We'll complete the fencing to the land exhibit to connect the two together. Be sure to only close off three sides of the land exhibit.

Place the last section of exhibit fence to complete the land exhibit.
