While the land and tank exhibits have been placed correctly sharing a tank wall, they haven't quite combined just yet. You can tell when a combined exhibit has been successfully created when you see the tank wall change to a gray-and-white-striped one. To get the two exhibits to combine, the top edge of the tank wall should be at the same elevation as the land exhibit.

Open the Exhibit Information panel for the tank exhibit and then lower the tank wall by one unit.

Click the OK button to proceed.
