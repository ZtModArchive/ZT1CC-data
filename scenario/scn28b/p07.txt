There are two show animals that also use combined exhibits: the California sea lion and the Southern sea otter. Much like other show animals, the show tank should be attached to a normal exhibit tank in such a way that it creates a 'pass-through gate' between the two tanks.

There is a pre-placed combined exhibit with a show tank by it; lower the show tank walls so that the pass-through gate appears between the two tanks.

Open the Exhibit Information panel for the show tank and then lower the tank wall height by one unit.

Click the OK button to proceed.
