Excellent work! The features and exhibits shown are essential to the success of a true marine Zoo Tycoon, so if you find yourself needing a reminder on how to build these types of tanks and exhibits you can re-enter the tutorials from the main menu at any time.

Also, if you need any help or information while playing, press the F1 key to bring up the Help panel.

You're now prepared to take on your next challenge. Exit to the main menu and either try your hand at a freeform game to build your 'ultimate zoo,' or try the new Marine Mania scenarios to challenge yourself.

Click the OK button to proceed.
