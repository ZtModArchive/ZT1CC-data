Many zoos contain exhibits with both land and water - you can do the same in Marine Mania with combined exhibits! Create polar bear exhibits with snowy, rocky shores next to a deep pool of clean salt water to swim and play in, or try the same with a walrus or many other swimming animals.

A combined exhibit differs from other exhibits since it uses both land and tank exhibits in a special manner - it 'merges' the two together for the animal to live in. These combined exhibits are challenging to create, but the marine animals you place in them will enjoy these environments and will happily move between the two to swim and relax. We'll start with using a normal tank exhibit.
