The Endangered Species Committee has contacted your zoo's administration, seeking your assistance in their work in conserving endangered species. You and your team of educated researchers will play a vital role in the Zoological Society of your zoo. Work with them in preserving the lifeline of three endangered species. 

Successfully mate all three of the endangered species in order to sustain their numbers in captivity. You will also need to keep all of your zoo's guests and animals relatively happy. You are given 18 months to successfully breed these three animals. Be aware that besides keeping the animals happy and secure, there is relatively little you can do to cause them to mate. You will have to just wait for them to reproduce on their own. Good luck, their species' future depends on you!
