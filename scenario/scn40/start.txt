You have been hired to run a new zoo in the inner city whose focus is exhibiting some of the most deadly carnivores ever to walk the earth, past and present. Construction has already begun on the basic structures for the initial animal exhibits. Now it's up to you to finish the job.  

Keep in mind, the large dinosaurs (Spinosaurus, Allosaurus, T.rex) can be picky and quick to anger. You are better off trying to make their exhibit as suitable as possible before placing them. Otherwise, they will get angry and start to destroy the objects. If that happens, it can be tough to correct.
