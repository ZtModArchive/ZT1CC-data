This small zoo starts with three well-made exhibits and three animals ready for adoption. Match the correct animal with its preferred exhibit. Examine the names of the exhibits to get a clue as to which habitats will best suit the animals. 

To do this, click the exhibit gate and note the name of the exhibit. 

Once the animals are in the correct exhibits, six new animals will become available. Create suitable exhibits for three of these new animals.
