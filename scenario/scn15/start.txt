A wealthy industrialist is teaming up with the government of Costa Rica to create a new wildlife park. He is donating $50,000 to start the zoo, and Costa Rica is donating a large plot of land outside of  the city of Punta Arenas, on the edge of the rainforest. 

His directive is that this new zoo must have a large variety of different animal species from all over the world. In addition, the zoo must sustain a certain level of popularity with the guests who visit it. If these conditions are not met, he may well decide his money can be better spent elsewhere.
