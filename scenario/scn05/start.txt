The Planning Board of Seasideville, a small community in Florida, has recently approved the construction of a zoo to increase tourism. They have hired you to oversee the construction and management of this project. Because of a tight budget, your choices for animals are limited.

The goals for this zoo are modest. With the resources you have, build a small zoo where the guests enjoy viewing animals housed in exhibits that reflect their natural habitats.
